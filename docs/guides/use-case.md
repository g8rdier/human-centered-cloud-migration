# Banking Cloud Migration Use Case

## Challenge
A traditional European bank needed to migrate critical systems to Azure while maintaining strict DORA compliance. The main obstacles were:

- **Communication gaps** between cloud architects and compliance officers
- **Extended approval cycles** causing significant delays per application
- **Fear of regulatory violations** slowing down innovation
- **Lack of transparency** in AI-assisted decisions

## Framework Application

### Phase 1: Empathy & Understanding
- **Stakeholder interviews** with compliance managers and cloud engineers
- **Persona development** based on real user needs and pain points
- **Journey mapping** to identify critical friction points

### Phase 2: AI Tool Integration
- **DORA Compliance Translator** substantially reduced technical review timeframes
- **Smart Dependency Mapper** automatically identified numerous legacy system connections
- **Migration Sandbox** enabled safe testing of compliance scenarios

### Phase 3: Human-Centered Implementation
- **Ethical AI Board** ensured transparent decision-making
- **Mobile Companion App** provided stress monitoring during critical migrations
- **Real-time dashboards** gave both personas appropriate information views

## Results

### Quantitative Outcomes
- **Significant reduction** in total migration time
- **High compliance pass rate** on audit attempts
- **Notable decrease** in stress-related incidents during migration
- **Substantial improvement** in cross-team collaboration

### Qualitative Feedback
**Michael (Compliance)**: *"Finally, I can understand what the technical team is doing and provide meaningful input without slowing them down."*

**Sarah (Engineering)**: *"The AI compliance checks caught issues I would have missed, and the explanations helped me learn regulatory requirements."*

## Scalability
This framework has been successfully adapted for:
- **Community banks** (small-scale applications)
- **Regional institutions** (multiple legacy systems)
- **International banks** (multi-jurisdiction compliance)

## Key Success Factors
1. **Stakeholder buy-in** from both technical and compliance leadership
2. **Iterative implementation** with frequent feedback loops
3. **Transparent AI** that explains decisions in human terms
4. **Mobile support** for stress management during critical phases
