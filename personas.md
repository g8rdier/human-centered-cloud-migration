# Personas for Banking Cloud Migration

## Michael Berger - The Cautious Compliance Manager

### Background
- **Age**: 42 years
- **Position**: Senior Compliance Officer
- **Experience**: Extensive background in compliance, significant banking sector experience
- **Education**: Master's in Business Law, banking compliance certifications

### Technical Profile
Basic IT knowledge but not a cloud expert. Understands databases and security principles but has limited experience with public cloud architectures.

### Goals
- Ensure all migrations are DORA-compliant and auditable
- Minimize personal liability for compliance violations
- Create efficient processes without compromising security standards

### Pain Points
- Unclear documentation of cloud migrations
- Fear of compliance violations discovered during audits
- Often feels overlooked by technical teams
- Difficulty understanding and assessing technical risks

### Attitude Towards AI
Skeptical - fears "black box" decisions without traceability.

**Quote**: *"I must always be able to prove why a particular decision was made. Saying 'the AI recommended it' is simply not enough for an auditor."*

### Daily Challenge
"How can I ensure we meet all regulatory requirements when using new cloud services without becoming an innovation blocker?"
